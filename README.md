### Colour-scheme
To make the brand stand out I used the branding colours as the base colour theme for the design, this was a simple red, black and white. To make the design pop I added two additonal greens and a pink that would be assigned to a specific typography.  

- Primary colour â€“ Red: This acts as an active colour and also acts as a highlight colour for the footbar icons.
- Secondary colour - Dusky Pink rgba(221, 137, 203, 0.681): This is used on conjunction with the variable "Header font" (Pacifico). It is used to draw attention to things like events, online classes and juicing ingredients.
- Highlight colour: This has been applied to the navigation bar to highlight when the user is hovering over a tab. It has also been used as the base colour for the footerbar prior to them being hovered over.
- Booking-button colour: This colour has been applied to all buttons throughout the website.

## Deployment
To deploy the FWL website I used the Github-pages feature, this generates a link that can be shared so people can view the website with only the use of only a device and an internet connection. To use github-pages I had to create a repository and connect it to my VS Code (IDE), this is the development environment where the webiste would be coded and any changes would be commited to the Github repository.
